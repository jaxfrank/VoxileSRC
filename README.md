This repository is in place to maintain the source code for the Voxile project.

#Voxile
Voxile is a project with the purpose of learning about Voxel and Tile engines and the implementations of various features of such engines.
Currently the project contains a simple game engine and a simple(fully recursive) implementation of a quad tree. In the future I plan to work on oct trees and other more interesting aspects of these engines. This project might also branch into being a general research and development project in which I create whatever I feel like. There are no bounds to what can be done.
